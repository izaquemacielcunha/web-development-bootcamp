This is a project for The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp that I am doing. In case anyone is interested, here is the link: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp

At this point, I have learned about:
* What is front-end web development
* How the internet work
* How the websites work
* The html boilplate
* The main tags like H1, P, UL, OL, LI, A, IMG etc
* File paths
* Webpages
